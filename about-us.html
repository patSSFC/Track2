          <p class="copy-wrap">A landscape designed to be viewed in motion, with a wide array of large scale artworks racing alongside you. You’re racing some of the region’s and the planet’s greatest creative minds. This is a bus ride where the walls you pass are so interesting that you put your phone away. A train ride that sparks your imagination.</p>
          <img id="corridor-map" src="images/sodo_map.svg" alt="corridor-map">
          <p class="copy-wrap">The SODO Track will transform 2-miles of building backs into a vibrant street art corridor. Local, national and international artists will be commissioned to create an imaginative raceway of art in motion for 43,000 bus and light rail riders to experience as they enter Downtown Seattle each day.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap"> 32 properties will be painted by over 50 artists, in two summer festival phases. Phase 1 is slated to transform the east side of the corridor - 5th Avenue South between South Royal Brougham Way and South Spokane Street – with Phase 2 covering the west side.</p>

          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p class="copy-wrap">As Seattle continues to rise in the global art community, public development authority 4Culture and planning artist Gage Hamilton have teamed up to seed a unique street art corridor in the SODO Busway. This plan aims to transform the busway into an immersive coherent art viewing experience by working with local and international artists, the SODO BIA, and various regional partnerships. The SODO Corridor Public Art plan, created by Gage Hamilton for 4Culture in December 2015, documents the prioritized art opportunities, recommendations, and budget allocation for the plan’s development.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap">This plan envisions a cohesive art experience with dozens of artists bringing a diversity of perspectives and cultural influences, as well as a multitude of personal interpretations on the themes of movement, motion, and progression. The prioritized art opportunities are recommended to be completed with a two-year period, given a successful fundraising effort and partnership with strategic sponsors.</p>
