          <p class="copy-wrap">A landscape designed to be viewed in motion, with a wide array of large scale artworks racing alongside you. You’re racing some of the region’s and the planet’s greatest creative minds. This is a bus ride where the walls you pass are so interesting that you put your phone away. A train ride that sparks your imagination.</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap">The SODO Track will transform 2-miles of building backs into a vibrant street art corridor. Local, national and international artists will be commissioned to create an imaginative raceway of art in motion for 43,000 bus and light rail riders to experience as they enter Downtown Seattle each day.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap"> 32 properties will be painted by over 50 artists, in two summer festival phases. Phase 1 is slated to transform the east side of the corridor - 5th Avenue South between South Royal Brougham Way and South Spokane Street – with Phase 2 covering the west side.</p>

          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p class="copy-wrap">As Seattle continues to rise in the global art community, public development authority 4Culture and planning artist Gage Hamilton have teamed up to seed a unique street art corridor in the SODO Busway. This plan aims to transform the busway into an immersive coherent art viewing experience by working with local and international artists, the SODO BIA, and various regional partnerships. The SODO Corridor Public Art plan, created by Gage Hamilton for 4Culture in December 2015, documents the prioritized art opportunities, recommendations, and budget allocation for the plan’s development.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap">This plan envisions a cohesive art experience with dozens of artists bringing a diversity of perspectives and cultural influences, as well as a multitude of personal interpretations on the themes of movement, motion, and progression. The prioritized art opportunities are recommended to be completed with a two-year period, given a successful fundraising effort and partnership with strategic sponsors.</p>

          <h3>How We Chose The Projec'ts Theme.</h3>
          <p class="copy-wrap">We intend to establish an internationally renowned street art corridor by utilizing the SODO corridor’s unique layout to create an immersive, cohesive art experience in motion. While it is increasingly common to find neighborhoods with a high density of contemporary murals in many of the world’s most culturally vibrant cities, there are various factors that will make the SODO corridor stand apart.</p>
          <div class="rider_logo">
            <img id="rider" src="images/sprites/rider_thumbnail.png" alt="kyler_rider">
            </div>
          <p class="copy-wrap">The layout of the corridor means that the murals will be lined up alongside one another in a continuous line of sight. Each piece will be viewed in relation to those on either side of it -- centering all of the works on a common theme will create an interconnected viewing experience. When we also consider that the viewing experience will likely be via bus or light rail, then we have a truly unique opportunity to establish a continuous, densely filled, thematic art landscape meant to be viewed in motion.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap">The decision to have an overall theme for the artwork is twofold; to provide cohesion between artists, and to reflect and engage the viewers experience. The general theme of the artwork will be “motion/progression” as we transform the corridor into an imaginative raceway. This will provide just enough structure to tie all of the artwork together thematically, without micromanaging and restricting creativity. When the artists bring their ideas to life, this theme will engage the viewer as they pass through the corridor via bus or lightrail, racing alongside the imaginations of local and international artists alike.</p>
