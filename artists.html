              The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Mogul talk. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch. Cloth talk. The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started.
