              CYRCLE. makes murals, paintings, sculptures, and interactive installations that explore themes of life, duality, and the human condition. Employing a street art aesthetic and inspired by the traditions of graffiti and graphic design, the artistic duo of David Leavitt and David Torres (also known as Rabi and Davey) strives to reach an audience beyond those who intentionally seek out art. Their 2014 installation ORGANIZED CHAOS! explored the idea of pollination as a metaphor for society. The interactive puzzle invited viewers to take small cubes from crates and place them in gridded frames, like a bee taking pollen from a flower and bringing it to the hive. The work’s message was counterintuitive and direct: although nothing can exist without order, organizations cannot evolve without chaos.

              For the last decade Jeff “Weirdo” Jacobson has been a prominent force the urban contemporary scene in Seattle. From his vividly inspiring city block mural on 2nd Ave in downtown Seattle, to his inclusion in Chase Jarvis’ “Seattle 100” book of the most influential people in Seattle, Jacobson has been a making major strides and his career as an in demand emerging artist has been blooming. He recently received the prestigious 4Culture/Artist Trust “Conductive Garboil Grant” in 2011 for his murals in the Seattle’s historic Pioneer Square area. In addition to his larger than life spray-painted walls, Jeff is also known for his hyperrealistic yet surrealistically dreamlike gallery work. His canvases reflect his vision of a changing world underscored by darkness, yet balanced by a creative benevolent force. His work often features grotesquely surrealistic organic forms, inspired by plants, funguses, and corals, which sprout from hyper-realistic portraits. These figures and portraits display and astonishing level of finish and detail.

              "Mary Iverson is an exquisite landscape painter with a razor-sharp contemporary edge. On the surface, we see activism, her collages and paintings warning us of a dystopic future existence. But the truth is, this apocalypse is happening now. Through her paintings of rogue shipping containers invading precious, untouched vistas, she uncovers the gross excess and collateral damages of the shipping industry, and ultimately, commercialism.”

              Born in Southern California, Casey Weldon spent the majority of his formative years there graduating from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. After operating a studio out of Las Vegas, Weldon relocated to New York, then California, and now Seattle where he works as a full time artist. His fine art, imbued with a sumptuous illustrative quality, is indicative of his profession. Weldon mixes iconography of today and the past to evoke a sense of humor, nostalgia, fantasy and even melancholy within the viewer. His pallet and haunting subjects recall the Surrealist masters like Breton and de Chirico.

              Of his recent exhibit “Tropefiend" at San Francisco’s Spoke Art Gallery, he shares, “The subject matter has been more about dying man-made media, like television, radio, and print, and having them lost in the overgrowth of the constant of nature. It’s more natural than magical – maybe supernatural.”

              "Syd Bee is a Seattle-based painter that creates figurative paintings that often appear to exist in a dreamlike state. Working in oils, the artist employs a technique of creating a pastel-hued glow around her subjects. Bee enjoys the way the soft outer edges of the paintings feel optically; which enhances the mysterious effect produced by her oil paintings."
