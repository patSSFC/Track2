          <p class="copy-wrap bio">CYRCLE. makes murals, paintings, sculptures, and interactive installations that explore themes of life, duality, and the human condition. Employing a street art aesthetic and inspired by the traditions of graffiti and graphic design, the artistic duo of David Leavitt and David Torres (also known as Rabi and Davey) strives to reach an audience beyond those who intentionally seek out art. Their 2014 installation ORGANIZED CHAOS! explored the idea of pollination as a metaphor for society. The interactive puzzle invited viewers to take small cubes from crates and place them in gridded frames, like a bee taking pollen from a flower and bringing it to the hive. The work’s message was counterintuitive and direct: although nothing can exist without order, organizations cannot evolve without chaos.</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Born in Southern California, Casey Weldon spent the majority of his formative years there graduating from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. After operating a studio out of Las Vegas, Weldon relocated to New York, then California, and now Seattle where he works as a full time artist. His fine art, imbued with a sumptuous illustrative quality, is indicative of his profession. Weldon mixes iconography of today and the past to evoke a sense of humor, nostalgia, fantasy and even melancholy within the viewer. His pallet and haunting subjects recall the Surrealist masters like Breton and de Chirico.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Of his recent exhibit “Tropefiend" at San Francisco’s Spoke Art Gallery, he shares, “The subject matter has been more about dying man-made media, like television, radio, and print, and having them lost in the overgrowth of the constant of nature. It’s more natural than magical – maybe supernatural.</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Growing up in rural Colorado, Oregon based artist David Rice forged a special connection with his environment, which he develops in his colorful illustrations. His works focus on themes of nature through figurative portrayals of animals. Rice forges a link between the natural world and what is man-made. “The natural world is my greatest inspiration. Like much of the what I have done in the past, this body of work continues to explore themes of nature by personifying its inhabitants and introducing new themes of security, nobility and authority. The focus is on an animal’s individuality, rather than grouping it into a species of non-differentiating members.”</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Josh Keyes, like so many of us, is deeply concerned by the consequences humanity’s actions are wreaking on our environment and their harmful impact on the Earth and it’s future. Shooting from this standpoint, Keyes composes allegorical dystopian visions which deliver messages geared to provide a wake up call to the masses. Painted with a masterly touch and rendered with compelling realism, Josh’s images produce a tangibility that seriously strengthens the power of his forewarnings. Almost totally devoid of human beings, the world Keyes envisions, is populated by animals forced to evolve and adapt to a new way of life amid the symbolic remnants of humankind’s ultimately thwarted legacy. These fantastical scenarios of displacement come from a profoundly personal locus within Keyes and serve as a representation of his private psychic landscape.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Josh was born in 1969 in Tacoma, Washington and currently live in Portland, Oregon with his wife and artist Lisa Ericson. He received his BFA in 1992 from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an MFA in 1998 from Yale University School of Art. His work resides in numerous private and public collections throughout the world.<br>- WOWXWOW</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap bio">"Mary Iverson is an exquisite landscape painter with a razor-sharp contemporary edge. On the surface, we see activism, her collages and paintings warning us of a dystopic future existence. But the truth is, this apocalpyse is happening now. Through her paintings of rogue shipping containers invading precious, untouched vistas, she uncovers the gross excess and collateral damages of the shipping industry, and ultimately, commercialism.”<br>- Kristin Farr, Juxtapoz Magazine</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Los Angeles based Drew Merritt has resolved to defy categorization. Merritt’s vision of painting the human spirit with an urban mindset has allowed him to paint a broad spectrum of human capacity and the depravity of our shared situation in the twenty-first century. Whitewashed canvases mark his departure from a purely transitive style to a matured, complex, and iconographically jarring body of work. Treating each canvas as a borderland where hybridized forms and beings meet, Merritt throws light on members of marginal communities, unsung heroes, villains, friends and foes. Christianizing culturally ambiguous and sexually androgynous figures, his painted Others are icons of urban culture, contextualized by the ubiquitous grit of metropolitan dwelling. The starkness of his backgrounds are laden with faded visual memories, not only of his own style, but of the cities we find ourselves in today. His figures temporally and spatially timeless, inhabitants of a placeless place.</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Syd earned her BFA magna cum laude from Cornish College of the Arts in 2013. She lives and works in Seattle, where she can be found surrounded by a library of fairy tales, comic books, and two fat cats.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap bio">"Syd Bee is a Seattle-based painter that creates figurative paintings that often appear to exist in a dreamlike state. Working in oils, the artist employs a technique of creating a pastel-hued glow around her subjects. Bee enjoys the way the soft outer edges of the paintings feel optically; which enhances the mysterious effect produced by her oil paintings." <br> - Nathan Spoor, Hi-Fructose</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Joram Roukes is a Netherlands based artist, living and working in the city of Groningen. His predominantly large scale oil paintings are reflections of everyday life situations, observed, filtered and reassembled in a collage like way. The resulted paintings pose a fragmented yet cohesive view on today’s society and human behaviour.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Joram’s energetic canvases have an incredible liveliness that draws us into each surreal world that he constructs. In moments of great vigour and spontaneity, Joram’s brushwork recalls the intensity of the abstract expressionists’ emotive mark-making. In other areas, extreme control and meticulous attention is paid to familiar figurative representations tweaked with a surreal quirkiness. Joram’s capacity to seamlessly mix traditional techniques, urban influences, pop culture imagery and fantasy, displays a freedom that explores the full spectrum of what the medium of oil paint can accomplish. Blending graffiti roots with classically trained dexterity; Joram achieves a unique and inspired visual style with which he can communicate his many observations of the western world. Expertly combining high and low art, Joram’s portraits comment on contemporary culture, confronting viewers with our own untamed absurdity in an engaging narrative characterized by beauty, chaos and decay. <br> - WOWxWOW</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap name"><a href="http://www.lowbros.de/" target="_blank">lowbros.de</a></p>
          <p class="copy-wrap bio">The Low Bros is an artist duo, which is made up of brothers Christoph and Florin Schmidt. Their work most often centers around stylized animal characters with human features, and addresses graffiti, hip hop, skateboarding and other elements which influenced and shaped the artists’ youth in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap bio">The work of the artist duo is fueled by the complex interaction between two-dimensionality and three-dimensionality: It is the synergy of geometric and flowing organic shapes, cubic effects, expressive color grids and multifaceted patterns that brings their work to life. Influences from design and illustration can be seen, as well as the cool and abstract video game esthetics from the 80s and 90s, and the psychedelic shapes and colors of ancient cultures. Great attention is also given to technical precision and detail.</p>
          <p class="copy-wrap bio">The accentuated play of light and shadow intensifies the contrast and unites the seemingly un- unitable, such as street life and subtle natural mystique. This is done, however, in a rather light- hearted way, thanks to many humorous details, which become apparent upon closer examination. Ambivalence with a wink – this is how the world of the Low Bros could be described; a world where painted scenes are transformed into surreal places of wonder.</p>

          <p class="copy-wrap bio">Ola Volo (BFA, Emily Carr University) is a Canadian illustrator from Kazakhstan with a distinctive style drawn from history, multiculturalism and folklore. Her intricate works bring animals, people, architecture and nature together to articulate diverse stories rich with symbolism and elaborate forms. Ola creates winding narratives that lovingly acknowledge the subtleties of human nature while celebrating the little surprises of everyday life. Her work is widely recognized for its inventiveness and imaginative gesture; every character is full of spirited personality and inhabits a dynamic environment. Her work also lends itself often to the public realm with several of her murals helping to shape and beautify outdoor spaces in Vancouver. As well as creating commissions for a wide range of international clients including HootSuite, Vancouver Opera, LuluLemon and ENI, Volo also finds time to do her own gallery artwork and book projects.</p>
